# Development Setup

Last updated: 2026-07-17

## Current Environment Status

This project can run both local-first development commands and Docker Compose integration services.

Verified on the current machine:

- Git is available.
- Python 3.13.9 is available.
- Node.js v24.14.0 is available.
- `npm.cmd` works.
- Docker is available.
- Docker Compose is available.
- WSL2 is available.

Known local notes:

- PowerShell blocks `npm.ps1`; use `npm.cmd` on Windows until execution policy is adjusted.
- PostgreSQL command-line tools such as `psql` may not be on Windows PATH. Docker Compose provides PostgreSQL for development.

## Local Development Strategy

Use local commands for fast backend/frontend checks, and Docker Compose for integrated service development:

1. Backend FastAPI tests using the local Python virtual environment.
2. Frontend React tests/build using `npm.cmd`.
3. Docker Compose for PostgreSQL, Redis, backend, and frontend integration.

## Recommended Task Runner

Use the Python task runner for repeatable project commands on Windows, WSL, and Linux:

```powershell
python scripts/dev.py doctor
python scripts/dev.py status
python scripts/dev.py backend-test
python scripts/dev.py frontend-check
python scripts/dev.py check
python scripts/dev.py start
python scripts/dev.py up
```

The runner invokes executables with argument arrays instead of shell command strings. This avoids PowerShell profile noise, Bash-only operators such as `&&`, quoting problems in paths with spaces, and the Windows `npm.ps1` execution-policy issue.

Use `start` for the normal fast path with existing images. Use `up` only when Dockerfiles or dependencies changed and the stack must be rebuilt.

Python is the preferred orchestration layer for repeatable development tasks, but Git, Docker, npm, and platform diagnostics should still run through their native executables.

## Required Commands To Check Later

```powershell
git --version
python --version
node --version
npm.cmd --version
docker --version
docker compose version
wsl --version
```

## Git Rule

All meaningful milestones should be committed. Do not mix unrelated refactors with feature work.

## Backend Commands

Create and install the backend environment:

```powershell
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install --upgrade pip
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
cd ..
```

Run backend tests:

```powershell
backend\.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest backend\tests -q
```

Run backend dev server:

```powershell
backend\.venv\Scripts\python -m uvicorn app.main:app --app-dir backend --reload
```

## Frontend Commands

Install frontend dependencies:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm.cmd install
cd ..
```

Run frontend tests:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm.cmd test
cd ..
```

Run frontend dev server:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm.cmd run dev
cd ..
```

Build frontend:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm.cmd run build
cd ..
```

## Docker Compose Commands

Before creating real external database connections, set a stable local encryption key in `.env`:

```text
EXTERNAL_CONNECTION_ENCRYPTION_KEY=replace-with-a-long-random-local-key
```

Keep this value private and stable. Existing external database passwords cannot be decrypted after the key changes.

Start the integrated development stack:

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```

Start in the background:

```powershell
docker compose up -d --build
```

Check service status:

```powershell
docker compose ps
```

Stop services:

```powershell
docker compose down
```

Reset Docker-managed database/cache volumes:

```powershell
docker compose down -v
```

Run backend database migrations:

```powershell
docker compose exec backend python -m alembic upgrade head
```

Local URLs:

```text
Frontend: http://127.0.0.1:5173
Backend:  http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health
Postgres: 127.0.0.1:5432
Redis:    127.0.0.1:6379
```

## Docker Image Pull Troubleshooting

If Docker is installed but service startup fails while pulling images from Docker Hub, check Docker Desktop proxy or registry mirror settings. The project Compose file is valid when `docker compose config` succeeds; startup can be retried with:

```powershell
docker compose up -d --build
```
