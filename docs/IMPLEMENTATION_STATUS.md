# Implementation Status

Last updated: 2026-07-16

This document records what has already been implemented so the project can continue without losing context.

## Current Position

The project is in the first-stage foundation period. The target is still:

```text
professional data analysis workspace
  -> usable MVP
  -> extensible modular monolith
  -> later enterprise-grade data platform
```

Current implementation has moved beyond pure planning. The repository now has backend, frontend, Docker, database model, collaboration, import preview, formal dataset materialization, cleaning, SQL data views, chart/dashboard, audit/lineage hooks, task center foundations, and external database intake with preview, history, retry, and formal dataset materialization.

The project now also has a demo-ready MVP seed path for `prj_demo`, so the current implementation can be opened as a real working demo instead of only being exercised through isolated API/tests.

- External database imports are connected to task center, operation logs, basic lineage, dataset preview, and dataset quality profiling.
- Basic operation log and lineage records for implemented workflow actions.
- Persisted dataset fields and physical table name mapping.
- Demo seed script that creates/reuses a fixed `prj_demo` project, imports example CSV data, creates a cleaned dataset, saves a SQL data view, saves charts, saves a dashboard, and keeps task/lineage traceability.

## Implemented Database Foundation

- Tailwind design tokens now include the Workshop Toolkit-inspired sky, lilac, rose, and mint palette for gradual frontend visual-system adoption.
- The application shell now uses a grouped, project-aware sidebar with compact desktop mode, a mobile navigation drawer, and persistent access to the complete data workflow.
- The top workspace bar now provides route context, project identity, global navigation search, task-center access, and a consolidated workflow start menu instead of scattering similar action buttons.
- The workspace now defaults to a guided ordinary-user view and offers a persistent Pro view switch for revealing cleaning, SQL, connector, history, and trace workflows.
- The sidebar groups professional tools inside an advanced section that stays collapsed by default and automatically opens when Pro view or an advanced route requires it.
- The workspace home now uses a dreamy pastel guided composition with three primary workflow actions, an original dataset illustration, and a collapsible professional workspace containing the complete data flow.
- The data source center keeps local file intake visible by default while external databases, upload history, and formal dataset bridge details live inside an advanced disclosure panel.
- Data source, import, dataset, cleaning, SQL, chart/dashboard, and task pages now share a consistent artistic workspace header and compact project toolbar treatment.
- Placeholder pages remain only for features not yet implemented beyond the current data intake, dataset, cleaning, SQL, chart, dashboard, and task surfaces.
- Workspace home page now acts as a demo entry screen linking into the main implemented workflow surfaces.

- Login, project creation, member/permission creation, CSV/Excel preview upload, formal dataset creation, cleaning execution, SQL data view saving, chart/dashboard saving, task center listing, failure task recording, retry request flow, related-resource navigation, external PostgreSQL/MySQL connection create/list/test flows, schema discovery, external preview, field-edited import, external table import retry, external import history/detail, external table import, and external read-only SQL import were verified through tests or API flows.
- Backend test suite passed locally: 59 tests.
- Frontend test suite passed: 34 tests.
- Frontend lint passed.
- Frontend build passed, with only the existing ECharts chunk-size warning.
- Guided and Pro workspace modes, the collapsed advanced sidebar, and the ordinary/advanced data source states were visually checked against the rebuilt Docker frontend with no browser console errors.
- Demo seed has been executed successfully through Docker Compose.
- Frontend demo pages were checked through a headless Edge/Playwright pass against the running Docker stack: home, datasets, charts, dashboards, and tasks loaded expected demo content, and the chart page rendered an ECharts canvas.

## Current Limitations

- Uploaded file bytes are saved in durable local storage, with metadata in PostgreSQL.
- Uploads are staged before parsing, so failed parse attempts can be traced to an uploaded file record.
- Upload/import history is queryable by project and shows uploaded-file status, parse errors, and linked preview metadata when parsing succeeds.
- Import preview stores sample rows for confirmation before formal dataset creation.
- Parsed upload history records can restore their saved preview metadata without re-uploading the source file.
- Data Sources now acts as the main local file intake overview and links into import previews, task traces, and formal datasets.
- Formal dataset creation creates and populates a physical table.
- Dataset names are unique within a project to avoid accidental overwrite-like workflows.
- Dataset quality profiling is computed on demand from materialized rows and is not yet cached or task-backed.
- Operation logs and lineage records exist for the implemented workflow actions, but the lineage graph UI is not implemented yet.
- Task center records synchronous workflow actions as completed or failed/retryable tasks.
- Retry execution is synchronous inside the API request for selected safe operations; it is not yet backed by Redis/Celery/RQ or a distributed worker.
- File preview parse failures are recorded against staged uploaded files; user-correctable validation failures remain non-retryable, while unexpected parse failures can keep retry metadata.
- Authentication is still development-oriented and not production JWT/auth hardening.
- External database imports currently preview and materialize bounded snapshots through row limits; scheduled sync, incremental sync, and streaming/large-table import are not implemented yet.
- External table/SQL import retry is synchronous inside the API request and replays the read/import operation, but it is not yet backed by a distributed worker.
- External connection passwords use application-level encrypted storage, but production deployments still need protected key distribution, backup, and rotation procedures or a managed secret store.
- External connection testing validates basic connectivity through the configured adapter and product-level read-only policy, but it does not yet prove the external database user lacks write privileges.
- External custom SQL import uses the shared read-only SQL validator, but it is still not a full SQL firewall or database privilege audit.
- If frontend dependencies change while using Docker Compose, the named `frontend_node_modules` volume may need `docker compose exec frontend npm install` or a volume reset to refresh installed packages.
- API data sources are still reserved for later milestones.
- Scheduled sync and distributed worker execution are not implemented yet.

## Updated Engineering Constraints

Future work must preserve these boundaries:

- Keep project structure layered and readable.
- Keep important data paths traceable from source to final report/dashboard.
- Keep original source data durable so imports can be inspected or reprocessed.
- Avoid silent overwrites and accidental hard deletion of user assets.
- Prefer small, meaningful Git commits after each milestone.
- Keep the first stage as a modular monolith with clear future extraction boundaries.
- Use the Figma Community "Workshop Toolkit" as the primary visual-mood reference while retaining the existing analytics-dashboard reference for information architecture. The product should combine soft pastel layers and friendly accents with compact, professional data work surfaces.

## Recommended Next Build Step

The next implementation step should make larger imports reliable without jumping directly to a distributed platform:

1. Add chunked reads and batched PostgreSQL writes for larger file and external-database imports.
2. Move long-running imports behind the existing task boundary with progress updates and cancellation-safe failure records.
3. Introduce a lightweight worker adapter that can later switch to Redis/Celery or RQ before scheduled sync is added.

This order keeps the main data workflow traceable while avoiding premature Celery/RQ complexity.
